# CASTILLO_ECE2112_PA_3
## **Description**: This Repository contains one Jupyter Notebook file that mainly revolves around Python Data Analysis and Matplotlib.
#### Created by: CASTILLO, Aurabella Macy F.
#### I am a 2nd Year Electronics Engineering Student from the University of Santo Tomas.
#### This is my 4th Experiment-Programming Assignment for ECE2112 (Advance Programming).
## The following are the Intended Learning Outcomes for this assignment:
####   1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
####   2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization
## The following are the things that I have learned in this Programming Assignment:
####   1. A visualization of your table of data can be done by accessing the Matplotlib library.
####   2. You can indicate which columns shall be filtered and extract the row that agrees with your boolean function.
####   3. Data wrangling is the easiest way to filter a data without manually inputting what rows do you want to print.
####   4. There are exactly six kinds of plot that you can use for your data when using Matplotlib: line plot, bar plot, scatter plot, pie plot, area plot, histogram plot.
####   5. You can use hexcodes for the color of your plots so that it will look presentable.
## Jupyter Notebook file: 2ECE-C Catillo PA 4.ipynb
### **Problem 1**: Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
####    a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
####    b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female
#### *Expected Outcomes:*
####   *a. Data Wrangling of Name, GEAS, and Electronics with Track-Instrumentation and Hometown-Luzon as constant*
####   *b. Data Wrangling of Name, Track, Elctronics, and an Average greater than or equal to 55 with Hometown-Mindanao and Gender-Female as constant*
### **Problem 2**: Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
#### *Expected Outcomes:*
####   *A graph of how different features contribute to the average grade*
